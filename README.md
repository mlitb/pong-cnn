# Pong cnn
> Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell.

### Introduction
This is the implementation of training a RL agent to play the mighty game of Pong.

### Requirements
In order to train a RL agent to play the mighty game of Pong, you need to run it on **Python3** and install:
1. gym
```
pip install gym
```
2. gym atari
```
pip install "gym[atari]"
```
3. numpy
```
pip install numpy
```

### Train RL agent
Run this command on your terminal
```
python pong.py
```
```
Arguments :
-l, --load <pkl_path> #path to the saved model to load from
-s, --save <folder_path> #path to the folder to save model
-r, --render #whether to render the environment or not
```
